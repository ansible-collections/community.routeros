minor_changes:
  - api_info - new parameter ``include_builtin`` which allows to include "builtin" entries that are automatically generated by ROS and cannot be modified by the user
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/130).
trivial:
  - api_modify - ignore  ``builtin`` entries
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/130).
