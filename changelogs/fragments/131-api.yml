minor_changes:
  - api_modify, api_info - support API paths ``ipv6 address``, ``ipv6 dhcp-server``, ``ipv6 dhcp-server option``, ``ipv6 route``, ``queue tree``, ``routing ospf area``, ``routing ospf area range``, ``routing ospf instance``, ``routing ospf interface-template``, ``routing pimsm instance``, ``routing pimsm interface-template``
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/131)
  - api_modify, api_info - support for fields ``blackhole``, ``pref-src``, ``routing-table``, ``suppress-hw-offload``, ``type``, ``vrf-interface`` in ``ip route`` path
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/131)
known_issues:
  - api_modify - when limits for entries in ``queue tree`` are defined as human readable - e.g. 25M, the configuration will be correctly set in ROS, but the module will indicate the item is changed on every run even when there was no change done. This is caused by the ROS API which returns the number in bytes - e.g. 25000000 (which is inconsistent with the CLI behavior). In order to mitigate that, the limits have to be defined in bytes (those will still appear as human readable in the ROS CLI).

  - ``routing ospf area``, ``routing ospf area range``, ``routing ospf instance``, ``routing ospf interface-template`` paths are not fully implemeted for ROS6 due to the significat changes between ROS6 and ROS7.

bugfixes:
  - ``queue interface`` path works with api_modify now
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/131).
  - ``ip route`` entry can be defined wihtout the need of ``gateway`` field (which is correct for unreachable/blackhole type of routes).
