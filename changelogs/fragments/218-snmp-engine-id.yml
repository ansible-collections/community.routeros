bugfixes:
  - "api_info, api_modify - in the ``snmp`` path, ensure that ``engine-id-suffix`` is only available on RouterOS 7.10+, and that ``engine-id`` is read-only on RouterOS 7.10+ (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/issues/208, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/218)."
