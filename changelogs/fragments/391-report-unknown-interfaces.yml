    api_facts - also report interfaces that are inferred only by reference by IP addresses.
    RouterOS's APIs have IPv4 and IPv6 addresses point at interfaces by their name, which can
    change over time and in-between API calls, such that interfaces may have been enumerated
    under another name, or not at all (i.e. when removed). Such interfaces are now reported
    under their new or temporary name and with a synthetic ``type`` property set to differentiate
    the more likely and positively confirmed removal case (with ``type: "ansible:unknown"``) from
    the unlikely and probably transient naming mismatch (with ``type: "ansible:mismatch"``).
    Previously, api_facts would have crashed with a `KeyError` exception.
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/391).
