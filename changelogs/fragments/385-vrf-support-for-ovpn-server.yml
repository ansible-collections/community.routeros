minor_changes:
  - api_info, api_modify - since RouterOS 7.17 VRF is supported for OVPN server.
    It now supports multiple entries, while ``api_modify`` so far only accepted a single entry.
    The ``interface ovpn-server server`` path now allows multiple entries
    on RouterOS 7.17 and newer
    (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/383).
