minor_changes:
  - "All software licenses are now in the ``LICENSES/`` directory of the collection root. Moreover, ``SPDX-License-Identifier:`` is used to declare the applicable license for every file that is not automatically generated (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/101)."
bugfixes:
  - "Include ``LICENSES/BSD-2-Clause.txt`` file for the ``routeros`` module utils (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/101)."
