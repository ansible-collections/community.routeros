Bugfixes
--------

- api_modify - ``ip route`` entry can be defined without the need of ``gateway`` field, which is correct for unreachable/blackhole type of routes (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/131).

- command, facts - commands do not timeout in safe mode anymore (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/134).

Known Issues
------------

- api_modify - when limits for entries in ``queue tree`` are defined as human readable - for example ``25M`` -, the configuration will be correctly set in ROS, but the module will indicate the item is changed on every run even when there was no change done. This is caused by the ROS API which returns the number in bytes - for example ``25000000`` (which is inconsistent with the CLI behavior). In order to mitigate that, the limits have to be defined in bytes (those will still appear as human readable in the ROS CLI) (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/131).
- api_modify, api_info - ``routing ospf area``, ``routing ospf area range``, ``routing ospf instance``, ``routing ospf interface-template`` paths are not fully implemeted for ROS6 due to the significat changes between ROS6 and ROS7 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/131).

v2.3.1
======

Release Summary
---------------

Maintenance release with improved documentation.

Known Issues
------------

- The ``community.routeros.command`` module claims to support check mode. Since it cannot judge whether the commands executed modify state or not, this behavior is incorrect. Since this potentially breaks existing playbooks, we will not change this behavior until community.routeros 3.0.0.

v2.3.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Feature and bugfix release.

Minor Changes
-------------

- The collection repository conforms to the `REUSE specification <https://reuse.software/spec/>`__ except for the changelog fragments (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/108).
- api* modules - added ``timeout`` parameter (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/109).
- api_modify, api_info - support API path ``ip firewall mangle`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/110).

Bugfixes
--------

- api_modify, api_info - make API path ``ip dhcp-server`` support ``script``, and ``ip firewall nat`` support ``in-interface`` and ``in-interface-list`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/110).

v2.2.1
======

Release Summary
---------------

Bugfix release.

Bugfixes
--------

- api_modify, api_info - make API path ``ip dhcp-server lease`` support ``server=all`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/issues/104, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/107).
- api_modify, api_info - make API path ``ip dhcp-server network`` support missing options ``boot-file-name``, ``dhcp-option-set``, ``dns-none``, ``domain``, and ``next-server`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/issues/104, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/106).

v2.2.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

New feature release.

Minor Changes
-------------

- All software licenses are now in the ``LICENSES/`` directory of the collection root. Moreover, ``SPDX-License-Identifier:`` is used to declare the applicable license for every file that is not automatically generated (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/101).

Bugfixes
--------

- Include ``LICENSES/BSD-2-Clause.txt`` file for the ``routeros`` module utils (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/101).

New Modules
-----------

- api_info - Retrieve information from API
- api_modify - Modify data at paths with API

v2.1.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Feature and bugfix release with new modules.

Minor Changes
-------------

- Added a ``community.routeros.api`` module defaults group. Use with ``group/community.routeros.api`` to provide options for all API-based modules (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/89).
- Prepare collection for inclusion in an Execution Environment by declaring its dependencies (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/83).
- api - add new option ``extended query`` more complex queries against RouterOS API (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/63).
- api - update ``query`` to accept symbolic parameters (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/63).
- api* modules - allow to set an encoding other than the default ASCII for communicating with the API (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/95).

Bugfixes
--------

- query - fix query function check for ``.id`` vs. ``id`` arguments to not conflict with routeros arguments like ``identity`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/68, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/issues/67).

- api_find_and_modify - Find and modify information using the API

v2.0.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

A new major release with breaking changes in the behavior of ``community.routeros.api`` and ``community.routeros.command``.

Minor Changes
-------------

- api - make validation of ``WHERE`` for ``query`` more strict (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/53).
- command - the ``commands`` and ``wait_for`` options now convert the list elements to strings (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/55).
- facts - the ``gather_subset`` option now converts the list elements to strings (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/55).

Breaking Changes / Porting Guide
--------------------------------

- api - due to a programming error, the module never failed on errors. This has now been fixed. If you are relying on the module not failing in case of idempotent commands (resulting in errors like ``failure: already have such address``), you need to adjust your roles/playbooks. We suggest to use ``failed_when`` to accept failure in specific circumstances, for example ``failed_when: "'failure: already have ' in result.msg[0]"`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/39).
- api - splitting commands no longer uses a naive split by whitespace, but a more RouterOS CLI compatible splitting algorithm (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/45).
- command - the module now always indicates that a change happens. If this is not correct, please use ``changed_when`` to determine the correct changed status for a task (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/50).

Bugfixes
--------

- api - improve splitting of ``WHERE`` queries (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/47).
- api - when converting result lists to dictionaries, no longer removes second ``=`` and text following that if present (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/47).
- routeros cliconf plugin - adjust function signature that was modified in Ansible after creation of this plugin (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/43).

New Plugins
-----------

Filter
~~~~~~

- join - Join a list of arguments to a command
- list_to_dict - Convert a list of arguments to a list of dictionary
- quote_argument - Quote an argument
- quote_argument_value - Quote an argument value
- split - Split a command into arguments

v1.2.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Bugfix and feature release.

Minor Changes
-------------

- Avoid internal ansible-core module_utils in favor of equivalent public API available since at least Ansible 2.9 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/38).
- api - add options ``validate_certs`` (default value ``true``), ``validate_cert_hostname`` (default value ``false``), and ``ca_path`` to control certificate validation (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/37).
- api - rename option ``ssl`` to ``tls``, and keep the old name as an alias (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/37).
- fact - add fact ``ansible_net_config_nonverbose`` to get idempotent config (no date, no verbose) (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/23).

Bugfixes
--------

- api - when using TLS/SSL, remove explicit cipher configuration to insecure values, which also makes it impossible to connect to newer RouterOS versions (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/34).

v1.1.0
======

Release Summary

v1.0.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

This is the first production (non-prerelease) release of ``community.routeros``.


Bugfixes

======

Release Summary
---------------

Small improvements and bugfixes over the initial release.

Bugfixes
--------
