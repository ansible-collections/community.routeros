.. contents:: Topics


v1.2.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Bugfix and feature release.

Minor Changes
-------------

- Avoid internal ansible-core module_utils in favor of equivalent public API available since at least Ansible 2.9 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/38).
- api - add options ``validate_certs`` (default value ``true``), ``validate_cert_hostname`` (default value ``false``), and ``ca_path`` to control certificate validation (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/37).
- api - rename option ``ssl`` to ``tls``, and keep the old name as an alias (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/37).
- fact - add fact ``ansible_net_config_nonverbose`` to get idempotent config (no date, no verbose) (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/23).

Bugfixes
--------

- api - when using TLS/SSL, remove explicit cipher configuration to insecure values, which also makes it impossible to connect to newer RouterOS versions (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.routeros/pull/34).

v1.1.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

This release allow dashes in usernames for SSH-based modules.

Minor Changes
-------------

Maintenance release with a bugfix for ``api``.

Bugfixes

v1.0.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

This is the first production (non-prerelease) release of ``community.routeros``.

Small improvements and bugfixes over the initial release.

v0.1.0

Release Summary
---------------

The ``community.routeros`` continues the work on the Ansible RouterOS modules from their state in ``community.network`` 1.2.0. The changes listed here are thus relative to the modules ``community.network.routeros_*``.
